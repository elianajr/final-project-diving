            description=""" The more we surf, the more we discover about the effect of the elements on the wave riders' health.

                           Surfer's ear - scientifically known as exostosis - is one of the most common conditions affecting those who spend hours in the sea, especially in cold air and water temperatures.

                           It is the result of frequent exposure to cold wind and water and causes bony growth to develop within the ear.

                           Eventually, you may have more bone in your ear than the actual canal.

                           If you don't treat it, surfer's ear can lead to severe problems from muffled hearing through to deafness.

                           There is only one way to prevent a very unpleasant surgery to remove bony growths - earplugs."""
